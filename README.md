# dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repository]. It's a mixture from multiple sources (in its current edition, most notably [Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles)), and focused on development on Ubuntu. 

### installing

* Fork this repository (or clone straight into your local machine), for example into ~/.dotfiles
* Review and run `symlink-setup.sh`. This will symlink everything from `./dotfiles` into the home folder
* Review the git and shell shortcuts
* Go into the `apps` folder and visit the folders of interest, reviewing and executing each `install.sh` file as needed.
