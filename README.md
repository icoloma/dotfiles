## dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repository. It's a fork from [Holfman repo](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.git) adapted to my favorite tools.

There should be a lot for Java, zsh, atom/sublime and cloud computing here.

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/icoloma/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

For a more detailed description, go to Holfman repo.
